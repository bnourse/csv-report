I left a bunch of different files here for my own future reference

csv-hash.rb - a working, hash-based implementation with extension goals, based on Sumeet's demo code

csv-oo.rb - non-working attempt to make it all oo from scratch, probably went too far

csv-report-pair.rb - working result of pair work, uses arrays
